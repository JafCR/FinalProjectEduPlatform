# Avoiding Common Attacks
A summary of precautions implemented to mitigate the risk of common attack patterns on smart contracts.

# Poison Data
The contract accepts differente types of inputs. To prevent poison data, the places that accept  inputs include the correct validation to mitigate this problem.

# Privileges
As only one administrator(owner) is the one that has control over the Educational Platforms admin methods (like university creation), 
I have created a modifier that is in charge of validating that the owner is the correct one, in this case the one that made the deploy of the contract.
I have also created roles to manage university owners, who are responsible for creating courses and can also withdraw the balance generated by their sales.

# Integer Overflow
The EducationalPlatform contract utilizes Open Zeppelin's SafeMath contract for all uint256 calculations in order to guard against integer overflow attacks.
